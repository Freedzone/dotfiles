Much dots. Such ZSH. Wow

## Info
I use ZSH almost everytime, except when feeling retro or working on SoCs.
For dotfiles management I am following [this][dotsmng] approach.

[dotsmng]: https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/

## Requirements
- git
- wget
- tmux
- zsh

## Installation
1. Download and run installer
```sh
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Freedzone/dotfiles/master/.dotfiles/install.sh | bash
```
2. Follow `oh-my-zsh` installation

### Recommended soft
These tools are not mandatory, but still very useful. Also dotfiles has some configs for them.
* [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - fuzzy finder (files, cmd history, commits, etc.)
* [TLDR](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) - simplified man pages with many examples
* [ncdu](https://github.com/rofl0r/ncdu) - du tool with nice graphics
